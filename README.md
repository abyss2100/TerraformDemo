This is a demo version of Terraform - Azure
Of course, subscription_id kind of secret information I removed, therefore, you cannot run (even after Terraform init) without updating this demo.tf
However, all other sections are REAL working condition including Resource group, VNet, public IP, VM, VM extension - IIS installation.
Thus, this is very close to a working version.
